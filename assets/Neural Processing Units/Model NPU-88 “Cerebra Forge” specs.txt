Integration Notes

Designed for synthetic intelligence frameworks, high-frequency neural emulation, and cybernetic cognition reinforcement systems

Fully compatible with NeuroSkin “Helios Spine,” “Specter Core,” and Argus Orb interfaces

Can function as central co-processor for distributed limbic AIs or as a stand-alone neural emulation node

Features “Cerebra Mode” — a temporary 400% overclock enabling deep cognition, data fusion, and emotional inference under controlled conditions

Includes BioLink tether for hybrid brain–machine synchronization using electrochemical feedback loops

Quantum mesh cores enable instantaneous data convergence across remote neural networks via photonic entanglement

Operational Advisory

Overuse of Cerebra Mode may induce temporary perceptual desync or host neural fatigue

Unauthorized firmware modifications may trigger the Neural Blackout failsafe, permanently disabling the unit

Maintenance required every 1,000 operational hours to recalibrate cooling matrix and entanglement stabilizers

Must be installed in a neuro-shielded chassis to prevent quantum feedback resonance
