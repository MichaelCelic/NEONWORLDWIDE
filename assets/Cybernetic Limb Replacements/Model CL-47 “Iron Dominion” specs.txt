Integration Notes

Designed for Tier-0 elite infiltration units and high-mobility shock operatives

Seamless synchronization with NeuroSkin “Helios Spine”, “Reign Core,” or Erebus Prime frameworks

Smart tissue micro-actuators shift weight distribution in real time to maximize agility

Overdrive protocol (“Dominion Surge”) boosts all torque channels by 440 % for 16 seconds before cooldown initiation

Embedded “Neural Blackseal” security lattice enforces single-user imprint, rendering external rewiring or cloning impossible
