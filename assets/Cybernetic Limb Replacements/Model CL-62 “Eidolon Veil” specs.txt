Technical Specifications

Manufacturer: NeuroSkin Technologies — Bio-Mechanical Augmentation Division
Model Code: CL-62-EV
Generation: 9th-Gen Bio-Synthetic Adaptive Limb Platform

Core Features

Chassis Composition: Dual-phase dermal composite—synth-organic skin layer reinforced with dermofiber mesh and carbonized titanium microplates beneath the surface for ballistic resistance

Skeletal Framework: Biofused titanium lattice with hybridized myomer bundles simulating natural musculature tension and elasticity

Power System: HelioCell bio-reactive generator powered by micro-fusion nanocells and hemofluid energy recyclers drawn from synthetic vascular channels

Hydraulic Architecture: Smoothflow BioTorque pistons delivering 6.7 tons of distributed force; dynamically modulated via user’s nervous signals for precise movement

Neural Interface: Q-Neural SynchroNet v8.5 — full biofeedback integration allowing pain-suppressed control and simulated sensory input through epidermal signal translators

Cooling System: Subdermal cryo-gel reservoir system with automatic phase cycling to prevent heat saturation under continuous load

Combat Shielding: EMP-insulated neural mesh; plasma-hardened understructure provides anti-shock reinforcement and dampened signal signature for stealth ops

Dermal Surface: RealSkin+ 4.0 synthetic tissue replicates pore structure, micro-hair patterns, and sweat response for full biometric mimicry; removable graft layers enable aesthetic customization

Integration Notes

Engineered for civilian-military hybrid users requiring natural appearance without sacrificing mechanical performance

Fully compatible with NeuroSkin “Aurora Spine”, “Erebus Prime,” and “Helios Synapse” systems

Self-healing dermal polymer layer regenerates micro-tears and abrasions within 48 hours under standard environmental conditions

“Veil Mode” activation cloaks heat and EM output while reducing actuator noise by 80% for stealth operations

Emergency override allows autonomous limb operation for up to 4 hours if neural link is severed

NeuroSkin proprietary BioSeal™ encryption layer prevents firmware tampering or forced biometric rebinds

Operational Advisory

Designed for infiltration, espionage, and high-profile replacement therapy where human likeness is critical

Recommended for Tier-1 field operatives, undercover android proxies, and high-risk corporate liaisons

Extended exposure to corrosive environments requires reapplication of DermalShield compound every 160 hours of field use
