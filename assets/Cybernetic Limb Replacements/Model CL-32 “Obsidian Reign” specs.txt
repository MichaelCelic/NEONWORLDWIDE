Integration Notes

Classified military-grade augmentation reserved for Tier-0 operatives and black-ops contractors

Full-body synchronization possible when paired with NeuroSkin “Helios Spine” or “Erebus Prime” neural systems

Adaptive muscle fibers reconfigure density based on user’s combat stance or load-bearing profile

Overdrive protocol (“Reign Mode”) enables temporary quadruple torque output for 14 seconds, with bio-risk warnings suppressed

Proprietary “Neural Blackseal” firmware prevents external tampering and enforces single-user neural imprint
