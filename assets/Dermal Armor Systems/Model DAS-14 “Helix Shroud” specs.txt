**Technical Specifications

Manufacturer: NeuroSkin Technologies — Subdermal Defense Division
Model Code: DAS-14-HS
Generation: 7th-Gen Adaptive Subdermal Mesh

Core Features

Material Composition: Interwoven tri-metal nano-filaments combining titani-graphene alloy, ferrocarbon microcables, and passivated copper-nickel strands for optimal strength-to-weight ratio and conductive stability.

Lattice Architecture: Multi-scale Helix Weave — concentric micro-helix rows produce anisotropic stiffness (flexible along musculature lines, rigid against perpendicular impacts) and distribute kinetic loads across tens of thousands of micro-nodes.

Adaptive Dampening: Embedded viscoelastic microcells that transition from pliant to semi-rigid under high-strain rates, providing immediate energy redistribution and blunt-force mitigation.

EM/IR Signature Management: Low-glint ceramic coating with embedded metamaterial filaments that reduce IR emissivity and scatter radar/optical interrogation for low detectability under synthetic skin.

Bio-Integration Layer: Bio-neutral adhesive interface with micro-textured anchors for secure lamination beneath epidermal overlays; conductive trace network allows passive telemetry with host systems.

Self-Repair: Nano-weld micro-agents stored in filament reservoirs enable localized repair of micro-fractures (restores surface integrity up to 80% within 12 minutes of activation).

Form Factor: Ultra-thin flexible sheet available in custom cut-patterns to conform to forearm, biceps, thigh, or full arm shells; nominal thickness 0.95–1.6 mm depending on weave density.

Performance Metrics

Auto-Repair Efficiency	Restores up to 80% micro-damage within 12 minutes (activation heat / current)
Integration Notes

Designed to be installed between an implant’s outer structural shell and the cosmetic epidermal overlay; compatible with NeuroSkin limb housings and modular cranial plates.

Cut-to-shape kits available for forearm (DAS-14-FA), upper arm (DAS-14-UA), thigh (DAS-14-TH) and full arm assemblies (DAS-14-FA+UA).

Passive telemetry lines allow readouts of mesh fatigue and temperature through standard NeuroLink connectors; full integration with Helios Spine for synchronized status feeds.

Cosmetic overlays (synthetic dermis) remain fully compatible; Helix Shroud’s low profile preserves natural contours for minimal visible bulk.

Optional coatings: Matte Graphite, Bloodsteel (reddened alloy tint), and Ion Silver (reflective low-glint).

Operational Advisory

Activation of nano-weld repair requires controlled heat/current window; emergency field kits supply a single-use activation cartridge for remote repair.

Repeated high-energy impacts in a short window (>4 within 8 seconds) reduce instantaneous repair efficiency and require maintenance cycle.

Avoid exposure to concentrated plasma discharges or corrosive agents exceeding spec range; prolonged exposure may degrade weave bonding.

Third-party adhesives or unapproved epidermal grafts may interrupt micro-anchor adhesion and void warranty.

Recommended inspection: NeuroSkin certified diagnostics every 600 operational hours (or after any heavy-impact event).

Summary:
The DAS-14 “Helix Shroud” is a stealthy, high-performance subdermal mesh engineered to slip invisibly beneath synthetic epidermis and convert fleshlike form into a durable defensive system. It balances near-armored protection with low visibility and natural articulation — ideal for operatives needing protection without sacrificing appearance or mobility.
