Technical Specifications

Manufacturer: NeuroSkin Technologies — Synthetic Defense Division
Model Code: DAS-09-AW
Generation: 6th-Gen Subdermal Reactive Armor Layer

Core Features

Material Composition: Interwoven tri-alloy mesh composed of titanium-carbide nanofibers, flexible ferrocarbon strands, and adaptive graphene weave — optimized for multi-directional flex and high-tensile resistance

Structural Architecture: Micro-linked “HexLattice” chain design allowing full articulation under mechanical movement without compromising structural rigidity; engineered to distribute kinetic energy across 12,000 micro-points per square inch

Thermal Resistance: Phase-adaptive reactive coating that shifts thermal conductivity under stress — capable of dissipating heat up to 900°C or insulating against cryogenic environments

Impact Mitigation: Dual-phase dampening matrix embedded within fiber channels; automatically stiffens under rapid acceleration, deflecting ballistic and melee trauma through controlled kinetic redirection

Power Integration: Passive nano-inductive system harvesting electrical current from cybernetic limb motion; optional auxiliary connection to the NeuroSkin “Helios Spine” for continuous adaptive monitoring

Camouflage Layering: Matte-reflective surface coating minimizes infrared and radar visibility; optical blending compatible with epidermal overlays for realistic appearance under synthetic skin layers

Maintenance: Self-repairing microfilament network; regenerates up to 87% surface damage through localized nano-welding process within 10 minutes under heat activation

Integration Notes

Designed for cybernetic limb reinforcement, synthetic skin sublayer installation, or direct dermal augmentation on enhanced human hosts

Fully compatible with NeuroSkin “Eidolon Veil,” “Obsidian Reign,” and Cerebra Forge systems

Modular installation allows scaling across multiple body zones (arms, torso, cranial plates)

“Aegis Mode” automatically activates during high-impact detection, redistributing force to non-critical mesh nodes

Can synchronize with neural-link feedback systems to regulate limb temperature and detect armor fatigue in real-time

Customizable in Graphite Black, Bloodsteel Red, or Ion Silver finishes

Operational Advisory

Excessive repeated impacts (>3 within 5 seconds) may require recalibration of kinetic dampeners

Overexposure to plasma weaponry may compromise nano-welded junctions

Use of third-party epidermal coatings or adhesives may reduce regenerative efficiency

Routine diagnostic check recommended every 1,000 operational hours

Summary:
The DAS-09 “Aegis Weave” represents the pinnacle of subdermal protection — an invisible fortress beneath the skin. Blending flexibility with military-grade resilience, it ensures operatives can move like flesh and withstand like steel.
