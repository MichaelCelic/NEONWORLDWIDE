Technical Specifications

Manufacturer: NeuroSkin Technologies — Visionary Systems Division
Model Code: OE-09-SC
Generation: 7th-Gen Tactical Reconnaissance Ocular Platform

Core Features

Optic Composition: Reinforced quartz-carbon lens encased in poly-alloy housing with plasma-coated anti-reflective treatment and bio-reactive iris calibration

Sensory Framework: Adaptive multi-spectrum sensor array capable of simultaneous visual acquisition across infrared, ultraviolet, thermal, and electromagnetic spectra

Power System: Micro-fusion optical core with self-sustaining power relay through kinetic and bioelectric harvesting

Neural Interface: Q-Synapse 11.0 Direct Link — full duplex neural data relay with 0.0008 ms response time and built-in cognitive overload dampener

Processing Unit: Hexa-threaded Neural Compute Cluster integrated within the orbital cavity; features onboard object tracking, facial recognition, and threat mapping AI

Cooling System: Microfluidic coolant lines surrounding optic core; thermally adaptive nanogel prevents burnout during extended overclocked visual sessions

Visual Display: Transparent retinal HUD projection capable of displaying environmental telemetry, target acquisition markers, and holographic overlays directly on the cornea

Connectivity Suite: Encrypted neuro-signal uplink (NS-Link) supporting satellite relay, tactical network integration, and augmented communication streaming

Integration Notes

Designed for Tier-1 tactical operatives and cybernetic intelligence specialists

Fully compatible with NeuroSkin “Helios Spine”, “Dominion Net,” and Erebus Prime systems

Auto-calibrates based on user’s neurochemical balance and circadian rhythm

“Specter Mode” enables cloaked visual output, masking heat and EM signature from hostile scanners

Includes memory imprint firewall, protecting user from visual data corruption and neural hijacking

Ocular sync algorithms optimize with user’s secondary cybernetic systems for unified sensory feedback

Operational Advisory

Extended use of Specter Mode (>30 min) may cause temporary visual desaturation or neural ghosting

Unauthorized extraction triggers Blackseal Protocol, rendering the optic core inert

Optical data logs are encrypted with NeuroSkin’s TriaxCipher — classified for military-grade networks only
