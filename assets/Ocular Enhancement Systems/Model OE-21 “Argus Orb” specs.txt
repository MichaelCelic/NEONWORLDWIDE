Technical Specifications

Manufacturer: NeuroSkin Technologies — Visionary Systems Division
Model Code: OE-21-AO
Generation: 10th-Gen Spherical Ocular Prosthesis Platform

Core Features

Optic Form Factor: Self-contained spherical ocular unit (25 mm diameter) with polished synthetic sclera exterior and recessed lens aperture; designed for direct orbital socket implant or cranial modular mount.

Lens Assembly: Multi-aperture crystalline iris with variable-aperture micro-diaphragm and concentric adaptive refractive rings — supports both analog-like focus and discrete digital zoom steps.

Sensor Suite: Multi-spectrum imaging array (visible / near-IR / thermal / UV) fused on-chip with depth-field LIDAR microbeams and short-range radar scatter for 3D mapping.

Optical Processing Unit: Embedded NeuroCore APU (neuro-optimized DSP + GPU microcluster) with edge-AI for real-time object recognition, motion prediction, low-light denoising, and synthetic contrast enhancement.

Neural Interface: Bi-directional SynLink Optical Bus v9 — tactile and visual neural feedback with encrypted neural handshake and impedance-matched electroretinal contact pads.

Power System: Micro-helio cell with capacitor burst ring; supports passive kinetic harvest from ocular micro-motors and emergency optical scavenging through ambient light cells.

Cooling & Protection: Microfluid microchannel lattice around optic core paired with phase-change nanogel reservoir; hard ceramic outer ring with EMP-diffusion braid.

Optic Nerve Cabling: Reinforced braided optic conduits (flex-fiber + micro-coax) exit posterior housing as multiple cyber-optic nerves for direct cranial routing; quick-seal magnetic coupling for maintenance.

Haptics & Feedback: Retina-level tactile emulator for contrast / texture cues plus depth-haptic pulse for proximity warnings.

Firmware & Security: NeuroSkin TriaxCipher encrypted firmware with single-user biometric binding, Blackseal anti-tamper, and a failsafe cold-boot lockdown.

Integration Notes

• Designed for covert recon, surgical prosthesis, and elite operator augmentation.
• Plug-and-play sync with NeuroSkin “Helios Spine”, “Dominion Net”, and OE-series hub controllers; supports multi-eye array linking for panoramic stitching.
• Dynamic exposure and shutter management coordinates with implanted auditory implants to reduce sensory overload.
• Optional add-on modules: Secure Comms Beacon, Stealth IR Masking, and Retinal Data Buffer (128 GB encrypted).
• Quick-release magnetic posterior coupling enables clinic-level swap/repair without full cranial surgery when used with approved mounting frames.

Operational Advisory

• Specter Mode (EM/IR cloaking) available but limited to 9 minutes per activation to prevent thermal runaway; enforced cooldown required.
• Unauthorized extraction triggers Blackseal kill switch rendering data and optics inert; factory re-provisioning required.
• Cosmetic scleral overlays available through certified clinics; strong adhesives or third-party grafting void warranty and may trigger neural miscalibration.
• Recommended maintenance: NeuroSkin certified inspection every 12 months (or every 200 operational flight hours for high-use scenarios).
