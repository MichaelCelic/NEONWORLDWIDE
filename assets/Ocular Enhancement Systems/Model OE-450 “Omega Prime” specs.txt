Technical Specifications

Manufacturer: NeuroSkin Technologies — Orbital Systems Division
Model Code: OE-450-OP
Generation: 11th-Gen Spherical Combat & Recon Ocular Prosthesis

Core Features

Optic Form Factor: Self-contained spherical ocular module (26 mm diameter) with reinforced synthetic sclera and recessed orbital flange for modular cranial mounting. Exterior panels finished in matte ceramic-composite to reduce glare.

Iris / Logo Assembly: Programmable concentric logo iris — illuminated circular emblem ring (user-configurable) that serves both as targeting reticle and identity hologram. Iris supports micro-aperture segmentation for variable optical profiles.

Imaging Suite: FusionSight sensor matrix combining multi-spectrum CMOS (visible), SWIR photodiodes, thermal bolometers and micro-LIDAR time-of-flight array for instantaneous 3D scene reconstruction.

Optical Processing Unit: NeuroCore Edge APU with dedicated vision tensor engine and low-latency predictive frame synthesizer; onboard edge AI for object classification, motion extrapolation, and adaptive noise suppression.

Neural Interface: SynLink Orbital v10 — bi-directional electro-retinal contact pads with impedance matching and encrypted neuro-handshake. Supports haptic microfeedback and visual-audio crosslinking.

Power & Harvesting: Micro-photonic cell ring with ultracapacitor burst buffer; passive ambient light harvesting and kinetic microgenerators embedded in mounting flange for trickle recharge.

Cooling & Durability: Microfluidic thermal lattice with phase-change microcells and protective EMP diffusion braid; ceramic outer ring resists abrasion and corrosive agents.

Optic Nerve Cabling: Multi-conduit braided optic harness (micro-coax + fiber) exits posterior housing as flexible cyber-optic nerves with magnetic quick-couple ports for clinic servicing.

Security & Firmware: TriaxCipher firmware with single-user biometric binding, Blackseal anti-tamper protocol, and secure boot with hardware root of trust.

Auxiliary: Onboard encrypted data buffer (64 GB), optional comms beacon module, and removable cosmetic scleral overlays for appearance matching.

Integration Notes

• Designed for tactical recon, surgical prosthesis, and elite operative augmentation.
• Plug-and-play synchronization with NeuroSkin “Helios Spine,” OE-series hubs, and Dominion Neural Suite.
• Circular logo iris acts as visual key: when networked, it projects a short, rotating SIGID for authorized device handshake.
• Onboard predictive stabilization synchronizes with limb/torso actuators for reduced motion parallax.
• Clinic-grade magnetic quick-couple enables module swaps without full cranial extraction when used with certified mounting frames.

Operational Advisory

• “Omega Mode” (high-sensitivity predictive overlay) limited to short bursts (default 9 minutes) to avoid thermal strain; enforced cooldown engages automatically.
• Unauthorized removal or tampering triggers Blackseal lockdown, rendering optics and encrypted logs inert until factory re-provisioning.
• Cosmetic scleral overlays and third-party grafting void warranty and may compromise neural calibration.
• Recommended maintenance: NeuroSkin certified inspection every 12 months or every 300 operational hours under heavy use.
