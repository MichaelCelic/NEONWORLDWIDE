Technical Specifications

Manufacturer: NeuroSkin Technologies — Dominion Warfare Division
Model Code: OE-37-IS
Generation: 12th-Gen Thermal-Integrated Combat Vision Platform

Core Features

Optic Construction: Reinforced obsidian-carbon ocular shell with adaptive micro-fiber veins to simulate organic tissue; synthetic sclera reinforced with ballistic-grade nanoceramic mesh

Lens Assembly: Multi-layered flame-spectrum iris composed of luminal crystal lenses and gold-plated precision rings; designed to regulate refraction under high-temperature or combat environments

Sensor Matrix: Integrated Quad-Vision Array — captures optical, infrared, ultraviolet, and electromagnetic signatures simultaneously for full-spectrum battlefield awareness

Processing Core: NeuroSkin Fusion Processor v12.6 with hybrid quantum-silica logic gates; capable of 6.2 trillion visual computations per second with predictive motion analytics

Neural Interface: SynLink-Prime v11.3 — full sensory-motor feedback with adaptive emotional filtering; customizable threat-prioritization overlays via neural impulse recognition

Power System: Dual-phase nano-reactor powered by photonic recharge cells and microcapacitor pulse relays; allows indefinite operation under standard light exposure

Cooling & Protection: Internal cryo-phase fluid network regulating thermal balance; armor-shielded optic housing resistant to EMP, plasma bursts, and corrosive particulates

Optic Nerve Cluster: Multi-conduit braided cyberoptic cables with graphene-core insulation; capable of direct cranial link or wireless synchronization via encrypted sub-dermal hub

Integration Notes

Built for Tier-0 tactical operatives, high-risk military augmentation, and long-range recon specialists

Fully compatible with NeuroSkin “Helios Spine,” “Reign Cortex,” and Dominion Neural Suite

Equipped with “Inferno Mode”, enhancing visual acuity under extreme light, thermal distortion, or atmospheric interference

Overdrive protocol allows short-term predictive targeting and projectile tracing within 0.1° accuracy deviation

Synchronized tactical HUD integration with real-time battlefield telemetry and biometric overlays

Protected by Blackseal Mk.VI encryption layer — prevents external data siphoning or neural infiltration

Operational Advisory

Continuous Inferno Mode activation exceeding 15 minutes may induce temporary retinal desaturation

Unauthorized firmware tampering activates Failsafe Burnout, permanently disabling optical processors

Environmental compatibility: deep-space, arctic, desert, and urban conflict zones (certified to ISO-NR7 standards)

Maintenance cycle recommended every 500 operational hours under NeuroSkin supervision

Summary:
The OE-37 “Inferno Sight” represents the pinnacle of combat-grade ocular engineering — engineered for operatives who see not only through darkness, but through deception itself.
